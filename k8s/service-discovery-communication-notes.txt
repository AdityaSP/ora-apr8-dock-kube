1. POD initiates connection to hw-svc:8888
    1.1 pod /etc/resolv.conf --> 10.96.0.10
        1.1.1 pod has no info for 10.96.0.10 so fwds to node
        1.1.2 node has no info for 10.96.0.10 so would have fwded to its parent
        1.1.3 mesh n/w does inflight snagging and routes it to kube-proxy
        1.1.4 kube-proxy works as lb and rev-lookup to 172.17.0.6:53
        1.1.5 pod-to-pod communication 172.17.0.6:53 does dns lookup and returns
              ip for hw-svc ie 10.106.73.181
    1.2 initiates connection to 10.106.73.181:8888
        1.2.1 pod has no info for 10.106.73.181 so fwds to node
        1.1.2 node has no info for 10.106.73.181 so would have fwded to its parent
        1.1.3 mesh n/w does inflight snagging and routes it to kube-proxy
        1.1.4 kube-proxy works as lb and rev-lookup to 172.17.0.14:80
        1.1.5 pod-to-pod communication 172.17.0.14:80
